# Smart-Irrigation-System-Using-Arduino
This project aims to develop a smart irrigation system using Arduino to optimize water usage based on soil moisture levels. The system automatically irrigates plants when the soil moisture falls below a certain threshold, ensuring optimal hydration for plant growth while conserving water
