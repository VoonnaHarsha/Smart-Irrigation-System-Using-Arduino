# Smart-Irrigation-System-Using-Arduino
This project aims to develop a smart irrigation system using Arduino to optimize water usage based on soil moisture levels. The system automatically irrigates plants when the soil moisture falls below a certain threshold, ensuring optimal hydration for plant growth while conserving water

Components:
Arduino Uno board
Soil moisture sensor (e.g., FC-28)
Water pump (e.g., submersible pump)
Relay module
Water reservoir/containerTubing for irrigation
Optional: LCD display, keypad/buttons for user interface
